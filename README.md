# Pseudocode

PHP transpiler of my ict teachers pseudocode to c. It could actualy be done via simple regexes, but it was done for educational purposes to learn about translators.

It uses Recursive descent parser and shunting yard algorithm for parsing. Lexer is based on regex (to make it faster to develop).

> *Warning* 
> Please, don't use it to bypass pseudocode. It wont actualy help you. Rather try to understand all the algorithms.
> This project was made only to learn about writing parsers.
